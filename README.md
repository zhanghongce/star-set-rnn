This is a re-implementation of propagation (exact) star sets in Python using CPLEX API based on the methods proposed from paper:

"Safety Verification of Cyber-Physical Systems with Reinforcement Learning Control", EMSOFT 2019

And we used it on a 7-neuron RNN.

To run the code: `python3 rnn_dmv.py`
